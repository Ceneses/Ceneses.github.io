#Introduction
I appreciate the opportunity of expressing my thoughts about learning English from the perspective of engineering student.
#Importance
There is no double that English plays an important role in our daily life. When you are going to do some research on physics or mathematics, you will gain advanced or important knowledge by reading english document literature, which are mainly writed in English,  carefully.

When you want to go abroad for further study, It's obvious that mastering and speak English fluently is the basic skill for you!
#Experience
There are three stages during my learning English progress.
##Stage 1
It's a stupid thought that I don't spend much time on learning English because I am an engineering student,
so it's enough that just remember as many vocabularies as more.
I keep it in my mind in order to remember vocabularies everyday. Yeah, I do it. Someday, I realize that I can't remember all the words and forget the words which i remember with painstaking struggle five days ago quickly!  What's worse, my sense of listening is getting worse and worse.......
##Stage 2
During my lab research, I can read English document literature easily and quickly so that I thought my English level is enough to support my research. However, until I met a foreigner who ask me for help, I change my mind and make a decision to do my utmost to learn it well.
##Stage 3
Well, it's current stage where I possess intense passion and tremendous determination to learn it! Practice make perfect.
#Worry
With the progress of learning English, we often take some measures, such as listening English song, to learn it. For example, this picture is the screencapture of Music App. Everyday, there are some popular songs recommended by the algorithms to your phone.However, the songs recommended by the algorithms almost were English songs. And my friends met the same things. This means that the western culture is popular in our society , what's more, the traditional local culture is getting fade. As time goes on, I fear that we may forget our native culture........

So as one of members in the society, it's our mission to develop our culture and make it colorful. It's necessary thatwe must take some measures to recall Chinese culture and make cultural prosperity.

#Conclusion
I just thought English is the tool to help me work better. As the young people in the society, It's our responsibility to inherit and take over our culture well.
When we learn to gain new things with painstaking struggle, don't forget what you have possessed!
